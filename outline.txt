1. Establish Power-First Design Principles
Energy as a First-Class Metric:
Start every algorithmic decision by measuring actual energy consumption, not just FLOPs or latency. Build your development environment with power monitoring integrated from day one. Use tools like NVIDIA's power management library to get real-time power measurements during algorithm development.
Constraint-Driven Innovation:
Instead of optimizing existing algorithms, design new ones that embrace power constraints as features. For example, instead of trying to make standard attention more efficient, ask "what would attention look like if we could only use 10% of current power?" This forces genuinely new approaches.
2. Multi-Scale Development Framework
Algorithm → Kernel → Hardware Co-evolution:
Develop algorithms with kernel-level implementation in mind from the start. Don't separate algorithmic research from systems implementation. When you design a new routing scheme, simultaneously implement the CUDA kernel. This tight coupling reveals optimization opportunities invisible at higher abstraction levels.
Hierarchical Efficiency Optimization:

Bit-level: Mixed precision, quantization aware from design
Operation-level: Fused operations, sparse patterns
Kernel-level: Memory coalescing, warp efficiency
System-level: Cross-device communication, memory hierarchy

3. Specific Research Methodologies
Power-Bounded Exploration:
Set hard power budgets (e.g., "solve this task using no more than X watts") and see what algorithmic innovations emerge. This constraint-first approach often leads to breakthroughs that wouldn't emerge from unconstrained optimization.
Biological Inspiration with Hardware Reality:
The brain operates at ~20 watts. Study how biological systems achieve computation efficiency, then translate those principles to silicon constraints. For MoE, this might mean dynamic expert activation patterns similar to neural assemblies.
Adversarial Power Optimization:
Develop algorithms that actively try to minimize power while maintaining accuracy. Use techniques like adversarial training where one network tries to maximize power consumption while another minimizes it, forcing discovery of truly efficient patterns.
4. Experimental Infrastructure
Power-Aware Benchmarking:
Create benchmarks that report performance per watt, not just raw performance. Include memory bandwidth efficiency, thermal characteristics, and sustained performance under power constraints. This reveals algorithms that look good in theory but fail in practice.
Hardware Simulator Integration:
Use cycle-accurate simulators to understand power implications before implementing on real hardware. Tools like gem5 or NVIDIA's simulator can predict power consumption for algorithm variants, enabling rapid iteration.
Cross-Platform Validation:
Test algorithms across different hardware (mobile GPUs, edge devices, datacenter chips) to ensure efficiency principles generalize. Power-efficient algorithms should show benefits across the efficiency spectrum.
5. Novel Research Directions
Approximate Computing Integration:
Develop MoE and TTT algorithms that can gracefully degrade accuracy for power savings. Create "power knobs" that allow runtime tuning of the accuracy/power tradeoff.
Temporal Sparsity:
Beyond spatial sparsity in networks, explore temporal sparsity where computation intensity varies over time. For TTT, this might mean alternating between high-power adaptation phases and low-power inference phases.
Collaborative Computation:
Design algorithms that can split computation across heterogeneous devices (CPU, GPU, NPU) to minimize total system power. This requires rethinking MoE expert placement and TTT gradient computation distribution.
6. Implementation Strategy
Start with Extreme Constraints:
Begin development on ultra-low-power devices (mobile, edge) where power constraints are most severe. Algorithms that work well under extreme constraints often scale up efficiently, but not vice versa.
Iterative Power Profiling:
Implement a development cycle where every code change is immediately power-profiled. Use automated tools that can git-bisect power regressions, treating power consumption as seriously as correctness.
Domain-Specific Languages:
Consider developing DSLs that can express power-efficient computation patterns more naturally than general-purpose languages. This might include constructs for expressing sparsity patterns, memory hierarchy awareness, and power budgets.
7. Advanced Techniques
Learning-Based Power Optimization:
Train meta-models that can predict the power consumption of different algorithmic choices. Use these models to guide design decisions and automatically select efficient variants.
Compiler-Level Integration:
Work with compiler developers to ensure your algorithmic patterns can be efficiently compiled. Sometimes small changes in algorithm expression can lead to dramatically different compiled code.
Hardware-Software Interface Design:
Propose new hardware primitives that would make your algorithms more efficient. Engage with hardware designers to influence future chip designs based on your algorithmic needs.
