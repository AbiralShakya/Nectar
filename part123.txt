part 1: 
    algorithmic overview of hardware aware dynamic MoE routing

    we introduce a framework that leverages real time gpu telemetry, thermal signals, and kernel cost models to adaptively route token in 
        a mixture of experts at test time (no retraining requried). 


part 2: 
    theoretical foundations & cost model design
        we dive into why per expert operatoins, linear layers, activations, attenio have predictable energy / thermal footprints, how to build 
            lightweight interpolation cost models, and how thermal strate perturbs latency and power. We prove that undder mild assumptions about GPU powero curbges
                your router's smulti objective optimzation remians convex and thus easily solvable in real time

part 3: 
    deep ddive on gpu kernels and triton integration
