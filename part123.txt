Part 1: Algorithmic Overview of Hardware-Aware Dynamic MoE Routing

"adaptively route token in a mixture of experts at test time (no retraining required)": This immediately places your work squarely within the TTA field.
The survey's "Inference Adaptation" category (Section 3.2) is particularly relevant, as it describes methods that "estimate model parameters with a small number of samples using just a feedforward pass at test time, without any back-propagation." Your dynamic routing, informed by real-time signals, functions as an "inference adaptation" mechanism for the MoE's routing.
The survey also mentions "Model Adaptation" (Section 3.1) which adjusts source-trained parameters. While you're not fine-tuning the expert weights, you are dynamically adjusting how tokens interact with experts, which is a form of functional adaptation at test time.
"leverages real-time GPU telemetry, thermal signals, and kernel cost models":
This is where your work goes "beyond model adaptation" in a novel way that the survey hints at as an emerging opportunity. While the survey discusses adapting based on data distribution shifts, you're adapting based on hardware distribution shifts (e.g., thermal state, utilization).
The concept of "Normalization Adaptation" (Section 3.3) in the survey, which adjusts normalization statistics based on target data statistics, is a conceptual parallel. You're adjusting routing based on hardware statistics, extending the idea of dynamic real-time parameter adjustment.
Your use of "cost models" to inform routing decisions directly addresses the survey's constant emphasis on "efficiency" and "robustness" in TTA (Section 8.2). You're building a mechanism to ensure efficient and robust operation despite changing hardware conditions, which is a crucial practical concern for deploying large models like MoEs.
Part 2: Theoretical Foundations & Cost Model Design

"why per expert operations, linear layers, activations, attention have predictable energy / thermal footprints, how to build lightweight interpolation cost models":
This directly supports the feasibility of your "real-time" adaptation. The survey frequently discusses the need for TTA methods to be "computationally efficient" (e.g., in discussions of Model vs. Inference Adaptation). Your cost models provide the foundation for this efficiency in a hardware-aware context.
The idea of "lightweight interpolation cost models" is in line with the survey's discussion of "lightweight adaptation strategies" (Section 8.2, under "Efficiency and robustness").
"how thermal state perturbs latency and power":
This is a critical real-world "distribution shift" that your work uniquely addresses within the TTA framework. The survey notes that "complex and unpredictable discrepancies can arise between training and test data distributions, such as noisy sensory recordings during inference, an abrupt change in weather conditions..." Your work provides a concrete example of such a discrepancy from the hardware side and a mechanism to mitigate it.
This directly ties into the survey's discussion of "Dynamic inference" (Section 5.2), which aims to handle "continually changing environments with various distributions" and "catastrophic forgetting." Your method aims to prevent performance degradation due to changing hardware environments.
"We prove that under mild assumptions about GPU power curves your router's multi-objective optimization remains convex and thus easily solvable in real time":
This is a strong theoretical contribution that directly addresses the survey's highlighted "Emerging Research Opportunity: Theoretical analysis" (Section 8.1). The survey states, "most approaches are empirical and emphasize technical innovations. They often lack a deeper theoretical foundation." Your convexity proof provides exactly this kind of theoretical underpinning for real-time solvability, which is vital for practical deployment. It justifies why your router can operate in "real-time," a critical aspect of TTA.
Part 3: Deep Dive on GPU Kernels and Triton Integration

"cost aware kernel design":
This is the implementation layer that enables the fine-grained control needed for hardware-aware routing. While the survey operates at a higher conceptual level (what to adapt), your "cost-aware kernel design" is the how that makes the real-time, hardware-informed decisions effective.
It reinforces the goal of "Efficiency and robustness" in TTA (Section 8.2), by optimizing the lowest-level computational units to be aware of their resource consumption. Triton, as a tool for high-performance custom kernels, is perfectly suited for this goal.

    Differences Between Your Project and "Chipmunk":

The two projects are highly complementary, operating at different levels of abstraction but sharing the common goal of ML system efficiency.

Primary Adaptation Focus:

Your Project: Focuses on macro-level dynamic routing of tokens to heterogeneous experts within a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layer. The router's decision is based on the overall cost of an expert (as predicted by your cost model) and current hardware state.
Chipmunk: Focuses on micro-level dynamic sparsity within the attention and MLP layers of Diffusion Transformers. It reduces computation by identifying and only recomputing small, "fastest-changing" parts of intermediate activations, rather than routing entire tokens to different modules.
Granularity of Optimization:

Your Project: Operates at the token-to-expert granularity. Each expert, once chosen, generally performs its full (dense) computation. You are optimizing which expert a token goes to.
Chipmunk: Operates at the neuron/column granularity within the dense linear algebra operations (attention/MLP) themselves. It optimizes how much of the expert's internal computation is performed for a given input.
Nature of "Sparsity":

Your Project: Implements structural sparsity by selecting only a few top_k experts out of many, which is inherent to MoE.
Chipmunk: Implements dynamic fine-grained column sparsity on intermediate activations, where only specific neurons or columns are recomputed.
Hardware Optimization Techniques:

Your Project: Uses a KernelCostModel to predict hardware costs and GpuSystemMonitor for real-time telemetry to inform routing. Your custom kernel design using Triton is a future implementation step for specific operations like dequantization.
Chipmunk: Has already implemented and heavily relies on advanced custom CUDA/Triton kernels with techniques like "tile packing," fused operations, asynchronous writes, and SM allocation to directly optimize sparse computations for Tensor Core utilization.
Application Domain:

Your Project: General MoE models, applicable to various transformer tasks (e.g., language, vision).
Chipmunk: Specifically focused on Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) for image and video generation.
Novel Things for Your Project & How to Adapt/Use/Add On from "Chipmunk":

"Chipmunk" offers a deep dive into GPU kernel optimizations that are directly applicable to making your MoE experts, and potentially your router itself, far more efficient at a low level. It provides concrete answers to "how to maintain peak GPU performance with sparsity and caching."

Elevate "Cost-Aware Kernel Design" (Part 3 Enhancement):

Tile Packing & Tensor Core Saturation: "Chipmunk's" core insight is that GPUs love dense, large block matrix multiplications. If your experts, particularly the QuantizedExpert, are performing computations on inputs that might not be perfectly contiguous (e.g., if token batches routed to an expert are effectively sparse due to the router's choices), then "tile packing" is crucial.

Action: When you implement your Triton kernel for _dequantize_and_unpack, don't just dequantize. Design it to pack the resulting (or intermediate) data into dense shared memory tiles suitable for Tensor Cores, even if the source data is effectively sparse or non-contiguous from the perspective of the kernel's load pattern.
Code Change (Example src/triton_kernels.py): Your Triton dequantization kernel could produce outputs in a layout that's already optimized for subsequent linear layers (e.g., columnar or tiled format in shared memory), mirroring Chipmunk's approach to attention/MLP kernels.
Optimized top-k Kernels: Chipmunk specifically mentions optimizing top-k. Your AdaptiveRouter uses torch.topk.

Action: Implement a custom, high-performance top-k kernel in Triton that can be called by your AdaptiveRouter for its token routing decisions. This would reduce the overhead of the routing decision itself.
Code Change: Create a Triton topk kernel in src/triton_kernels.py and integrate it into AdaptiveRouter's forward pass. Profile its speedup.
Fused Operations: "Chipmunk" demonstrates significant speedups by fusing operations into single kernels (e.g., column-sum attention, MLP delta computation).

Action: Look for opportunities to fuse operations within your SimpleExpert or QuantizedExpert. For instance, can dequantization be fused with the first linear layer's multiplication?
Code Change: If feasible, write a Triton kernel that performs _dequantize_and_unpack and the F.linear operation in a single fused kernel. This would directly reduce I/O and kernel launch overheads.
Refine "Predictable Footprints" and Cost Model (Part 2 Enhancement):

Hardware-Specific Nuances: "Chipmunk" provides detailed discussions of H100 features like TMA, WGMMAs, swizzling, and producer/consumer warp specialization.
Action: Use these details to provide a deeper justification for why your kernel costs are "predictable" and how they are affected by factors like batch size, memory access patterns, and whether Tensor Cores are saturated. Even if you don't implement all these low-level features, understanding them helps explain your KernelCostModel's behavior.
Code Change: Your KernelCostModel's _calculate_base_energy, _calculate_base_latency, and related functions could be more explicitly informed by these hardware mechanisms in their scaling laws, even if abstractly.
