# Nectar

Nectar considers energy of the mixture of experts model (fundamental to scaling for modern LLMs, Diffusion models, etc) and reroutes experts during inference (a new paraadigm in test time adaption techniques) based upon energy profiles.

to consider: kernel optimizations for dequantization & ttt specifically (fused kernels, large chunk updates, tile packing)
