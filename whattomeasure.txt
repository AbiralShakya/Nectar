energy saved with adaptive routing
    metric: total energy_loss 

performance loss due to rerouting
    change in task_loss or accuracy

overhead introduced 
    latency increase from expert_timings

effectiveness of routing modulation
    expert usage change, entropy increase

responsiveness to thermal changes 
    time lab between thermal changes and routing change
