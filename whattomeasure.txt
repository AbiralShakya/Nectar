energy saved with adaptive routing
    metric: total energy_loss 

performance loss due to rerouting
    change in task_loss or accuracy

overhead introduced 
    latency increase from expert_timings

effectiveness of routing modulation
    expert usage change, entropy increase

responsiveness to thermal changes 
    time lab between thermal changes and routing change 


conttrol theory kind of 
    RL framing for routing policy

        thermal state + past timings as observation

MLSys Element	How You're Doing It (or Could)
Telemetry-aware execution	ThermalSignalGenerator, dynamic top-k routing
Runtime adaptation	AdaptiveRouter modifies logits at each batch
Sparse compute optimization	MoE experts routed per-token; potential to fuse sparsity into kernels
Profiling integration	torch.profiler, custom timers, pynvml
Energy vs performance tradeoff	Explicit energy_loss in loss function
GPU-aware scheduling	Based on temp/power and expert latency data


A dynamic system-level optimization layer that uses real-time GPU telemetry and runtime profiling to modulate compute path execution (expert routing) under resource constraints.
